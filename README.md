# FastPin

An Arduino library for safe and high-speed digital read/write operations.

## Stats
These stats were generated by running `Speed_Text.ino` on an Arduino clone.

The test measures how long it takes for the function to run 1,000 times and calculates the average duration. This process is repeated 1,000 times, and the final result is the average of all these averages. This approach compensates for the ±4 microsecond accuracy limitation of `micros()`.

### Read
- 1.32 microseconds
- 4.28 times faster than `digitalRead (5.66 microseconds)`

### Write
- 2.08 microseconds
- 2.36 times faster than `digitalWrite (4.91 microseconds)`

## Usage
``` cpp
#include <FastPin.h>

FastWritePin ledPin(LED_BUILTIN);
FastReadPin buttonPin(2);

void setup() {
    ledPin.begin();
    buttonPin.begin(true);
}

void loop() {
    ledPin.write(buttonPin.read());
    delay(50);
}
```

> ⚠️ FastPin only disables PWM timers in `begin()`. DO NOT use `analogWrite()` on the same pin.
